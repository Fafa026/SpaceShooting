# Space Shooter (Unity 2D)

A simple 2D space shooter game developed with Unity as part of my software development studies.  
The project focuses on gameplay programming, object behaviour, and implementing real-time interaction using C#.

## Overview
In the game, the player controls a spaceship and survives waves of moving enemies by shooting them.  
The goal of the project was to practice structuring game logic, handling input, and managing gameplay systems in a maintainable way.

## What This Project Demonstrates
- C# scripting in Unity
- Player input handling and movement systems
- Shooting mechanics and collision detection
- Game loop and score tracking
- Object spawning and enemy behaviour
- Debugging and iterative feature development

## Features
- Keyboard-based spaceship movement
- Mouse-controlled shooting
- Randomized enemy movement
- Score system based on defeated enemies
- Sound effects to enhance feedback

## My Role
I implemented the gameplay logic, player controls, shooting system, and testing of mechanics.  
The project was developed to strengthen my understanding of real-time systems and modular code design.

## Technologies Used
- Unity (2D)
- C#
- Visual Studio

## How to Run
1. Open the project in Unity Hub.
2. Load the main scene.
3. Press **Play** to run the game.
